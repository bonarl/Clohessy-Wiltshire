# Clohessy-Wiltshire

A Python implementation of the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations with a 3D animation of the solution given starting position and velocity and mean motion of the primary orbiting body.  
The Clohessy-Wiltshire equations describe a simplified model of orbital relative motion in which the target is in a circular orbit and the chaser spacecraft is in an elliptical or circular orbit. This model gives a first-order approximation of the motion of the chaser in a target-centered coordinate system. It is very useful in planning the rendezvous of the chaser with the target.
